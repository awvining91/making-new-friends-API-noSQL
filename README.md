# making-new-friends-API-noSQL

# Do cool things with social media!

This app creates an API for a social network using a NoSQL database.

## Challenges

Having just learned SQL relational databases fairly recently which I thought I understood alright, we are introduced to non-relational databases which are sort of similar but way different. It took me a while to understand Mongoose and how to set up things in NoSQL.

## Next Steps

I started running out of time on this assignment but I want to come back to it and finish it. From what I finished I feel like I had a decent grasp at what they were asking us to do, and how to do it, which is nice.
